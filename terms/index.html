          <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

          <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern the provision of services by Strength 9 Ltd ("we", "us", or "our") to you ("the Client"). By engaging our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

          <h2>1. Scope of Work</h2>
          <p>All projects are undertaken based on a written proposal or agreement that outlines the scope of work, deliverables, timeline, and cost. Any work not specified in the agreed proposal is considered outside the scope and may be subject to additional charges.</p>
          <p>We will endeavour to complete all work to a professional standard and within the agreed timeline. However, timelines are estimates and may be affected by factors outside our control, including delays in receiving content or feedback from the Client.</p>

          <h2>2. Payment Terms</h2>
          <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A deposit of <strong>50% of the total project cost</strong> is required before work commences. No work will begin until the deposit has been received.</li>
            <li>The <strong>remaining 50% balance</strong> is due upon completion of the project, before the final deliverables are handed over or the website is made live.</li>
            <li>For larger projects, we may agree a phased payment schedule tied to project milestones.</li>
            <li>All invoices are due within <strong>14 days</strong> of the invoice date unless otherwise stated.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to charge interest on overdue payments at a rate of 8% above the Bank of England base rate, in accordance with the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>

          <h3>3.1 Client Ownership</h3>
          <p>Upon receipt of full payment, the Client owns all rights to the final deliverables produced specifically for their project, including custom designs, graphics, and bespoke content created as part of the agreed scope of work.</p>

          <h3>3.2 Agency Rights</h3>
          <p>Strength 9 Ltd retains ownership of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>All underlying code frameworks, libraries, tools, and reusable components developed independently or prior to the project</li>
            <li>Any pre-existing intellectual property used in the creation of the deliverables</li>
            <li>General knowledge, techniques, and methodologies developed or refined during the project</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Where we use our own frameworks or reusable code in your project, we grant you a perpetual, non-exclusive licence to use that code as part of your deliverables.</p>

          <h3>3.3 Portfolio Rights</h3>
          <p>We reserve the right to display completed work in our portfolio and marketing materials unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.</p>

          <h2>4. Client Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>To ensure the smooth delivery of your project, you agree to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide all required content (text, images, logos, and other assets) in a timely manner and in the formats we specify</li>
            <li>Provide timely feedback and approvals at each stage of the project, within the timeframes agreed</li>
            <li>Designate a single point of contact who has the authority to make decisions on behalf of the Client</li>
            <li>Ensure that any content you provide does not infringe on any third-party intellectual property rights</li>
            <li>Provide accurate information necessary for the completion of the project</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Delays caused by late provision of content or feedback may result in revised timelines and, where significant, additional costs.</p>

          <h2>5. Revisions and Change Requests</h2>
          <p>Our project proposals include a defined number of revision rounds. Revisions refer to minor changes and refinements to work already completed within the agreed scope.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Revisions requested within the agreed rounds are included in the project cost.</li>
            <li>Additional revisions beyond the agreed rounds, or changes that alter the scope of the project, will be quoted separately and require written approval before work proceeds.</li>
            <li>Significant changes to the project direction after work has begun may be treated as a new scope of work and quoted accordingly.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>While we take every reasonable precaution to deliver high-quality work:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our total liability for any claim arising from or related to our services shall not exceed the total amount paid by the Client for the specific project in question.</li>
            <li>We shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities.</li>
            <li>We are not liable for any losses arising from the Client's use or misuse of the deliverables after handover.</li>
            <li>We do not guarantee specific results from search engine optimisation (SEO) or digital marketing activities, as these are influenced by factors outside our control.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
          <p>Both parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary or sensitive information disclosed during the course of the project. This includes, but is not limited to, business plans, technical specifications, customer data, and financial information.</p>
          <p>This obligation of confidentiality survives the termination of the working relationship and does not apply to information that is publicly available, already known to the receiving party, or required to be disclosed by law.</p>

          <h2>8. Termination</h2>

          <h3>8.1 Termination by the Client</h3>
          <p>The Client may terminate the project at any time by providing written notice. In the event of termination:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The deposit is non-refundable.</li>
            <li>The Client shall pay for all work completed up to the date of termination.</li>
            <li>Any deliverables produced up to that point will be provided to the Client, subject to full payment for work completed.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>8.2 Termination by Strength 9 Ltd</h3>
          <p>We reserve the right to terminate a project if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Payment is overdue by more than 30 days.</li>
            <li>The Client fails to provide required content or feedback for a period exceeding 60 days despite reasonable requests.</li>
            <li>The Client engages in conduct that is abusive, threatening, or otherwise unreasonable.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In the event we terminate the project, the Client shall pay for all work completed to date and we will provide any deliverables produced, subject to full payment.</p>

          <h2>9. Hosting and Ongoing Services</h2>
          <p>Where we provide hosting or ongoing maintenance services, these are subject to separate terms and a recurring payment schedule. Either party may terminate ongoing services by providing 30 days' written notice.</p>

          <h2>10. Force Majeure</h2>
          <p>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing their obligations where such failure or delay results from circumstances beyond the reasonable control of that party, including but not limited to natural disasters, pandemic, war, government action, or failure of third-party services.</p>

          <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
          <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes arising from these Terms or the services we provide shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>

          <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
          <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised "last updated" date. Changes do not apply retrospectively to existing project agreements.</p>
